- React Router for better web practices, navigation history and linkable activities

- Separate and reusable components

## Open-source Contributions

I have opened a couple issues if you are interested in contributing the EASIEST and CHILLEST open source project in your life. Looking for more activity entries and a re-design of the category button grid, which currently does not fit the theme of the site.

I am open to any and all feedback. Thank you for checking out The Boredinator
